I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute of Health Economics at Leibniz University Hannover.

I hold a master's in Economics from WU Wien (Vienna University of Economics and Business) and a PhD in Public Health from Bielefeld University. Before joining Leibniz University Hannover, I was a doctoral researcher at the Socio-Economic Panel department at DIW Berlin (German Institute for Economic Research). Previous affiliations include McGill University as a visiting PhD student and IHS Vienna (Institute for Advanced Studies) as a research associate in the Health Economics and Health Policy group.

My research interests empirical health economics & public health, with a focus on health service delivery (in particular system determinants of healthcare utilization) and on regional context and health. I also have a keen interest in spatial data and methods.
