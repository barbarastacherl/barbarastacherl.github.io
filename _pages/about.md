I am a PhD candidate at the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) department at DIW Berlin.

I hold a master's in Economics from WU Wien (Vienna University of Economics and Business) and am currently pursuing my PhD in Public Health at Bielefeld University. Before joining DIW Berlin, I was a research associate in the research group Health Economics and Health Poicy at IHS Vienna (Institute for Advanced Studies).

My research interests span health economics & public health, with a focus on health service delivery (healthcare access, system determinants of healthcare utilization) and on regional context and health (particularly mental health). I also have a keen interest in spatial data and methods.
