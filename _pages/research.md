In this paper we study the implications of local practice closures in Germany on the population's health status and hospital utilization. This is especially relevant considering existing and expected GP shortages due to a wave of retirement among physicians of the baby-boomer generation.
To identify causal effects we collate a list of geocoded practice closures in Germany between 2011 and 2016, and spatially match them with the affected patient population using a catchment area approach. Exploiting detailed survey data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) with the exact geographical location of the participants, we estimate the effects of GP practice closures on individual health status and inpatient stay using a difference-in-differences framework. We contribute to the literature on GP market exits by disentangling the two pathways through which care discontinuity might impact patient health: (temporary) unavailability of care and re-matching with a new physician. 
We find small negative effects of a primary care discontinuity for self-reported health but not for quasi-objective physical health. Further, we find sizeable positive effects for overall hospitalization risk in a given year (+18%) and for the number inpatient stays (+20%). We show that these effects differ by local GP supply which reflects different re-matching probabilities. The negative effect on health status is driven by individuals in areas with lower GP supply likely showing perceived health effects of temporary GP absence. The positive effect on hospitalizations is driven by individuals in areas with higher GP supply, likely showing referral effects upon patient re-assessment after GP re-matching. Results are stable across a breadth of sensitivity checks, reported as a specification matrix. 
Our results show that in settings with high GP supply, care discontinuity results in increased hospital utilization in the short run, while in settings with low supply, care discontinuity is consequential for patient health.
